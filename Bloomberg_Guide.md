### B. How to apply:
Bloomberg’s recruitment process is somewhat exclusive. The application link isn’t publicly available; you typically need to attend one of their events or be lucky enough to get contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn. Keep an eye on events hosted at UBB and UPB. 

### C. Recruitement process (2024 - Cluj-Napoca):
>**Note: This is a stage-gated process that takes approximately 1–2 months**

1.  **Screening**    
    
    After obtaining the application link, you must submit your resume. Your application then undergoes an initial screening.

2. **Interviews**

    Each interview usually kicks off with a bit of small talk. The interviewer will introduce themselves—how long they’ve been at Bloomberg, what they work on, that sort of thing. Then they’ll probably ask something like, “Can you tell me a bit about yourself?” They might also dig into your resume, especially focusing on a project of your choice (e.g., “What’s your favorite project?”). So make sure you’re honest, know your work well, and be ready to talk about it. Feel free to ask them questions too—they really care about cultural fit from what I’ve seen and heard.

    All coding interviews are done on HackerRank. You can use whatever programming language you're comfortable with—it doesn’t impact the process. They usually don’t run the code live, but that doesn’t mean your code shouldn’t work. Minor mistakes are okay, so don’t stress. These rounds also include culture fit and motivational questions, so be prepared for that side too.

    - **Interview I:** 
        - **Format:** Online (Phone Call/Zoom), 1 hour
        - **Focus:** Algorithms   
   - **Interview II:** 
        - **Format:** In person/Online Zoom, 1 hour, 2 interviewers 
        - **Focus:** Algorithms  
            > *Interviews I and II typically include LeetCode or HackerRank-style problems. The difficulty can range from easy to hard, depending on how lucky you are -karma is a bitch-. After solving the initial problem(s), you may be asked follow-up questions such as how to parallelize your solution, analyze trade-offs between memory and time complexity, handle edge cases, or adapt to new constraints. These follow-ups are designed to assess your problem-solving approach and depth of understanding. I would recommended to prepare using LeetCode, especially the company-tagged problems available with a premium plan.* 

   - **Interview III:** 
        - **Format:** In person/Online Zoom: 1 hour
        - **Focus:** System design.
            > *This interview is different—it focuses on how you approach the design of large-scale systems. You'll be expected to demonstrate your understanding of concepts such as scalability, load balancing, caching, databases, and fault tolerance. You won't be required to write actual code, instead, they focus is on your thought process, architectural decisions, and communication. You'll either sketch your ideas using a whiteboard or pen and paper. Don't be worried there is no correct answer!*

   - **Interview IV:** 
        - **Format:** Online Zoom, 30'
        - **Focus:** Behavioural
            > *In this interview, you'll speak with an HR representative. It’s a typical behavioral interview, where you'll be asked questions about teamwork, past experiences, how you handle various situations etc.. You should also expect questions that assess cultural fit, motivation, and your ability to navigate different workplace scenarios.*
   - **Interview V - Big Boss:**
        - **Format:** Online Zoom, 1 hour
        - **Focus:** Behavioural
            > *In this final interview, you'll speak with a technical manager about your background, career goals, and your resume. While the conversation is primarily focused on getting to know you, there's a possibility you may be asked system design or algorithmic questions.*

3. **Offer Stage**  
    
    Once you make it through the recruitment process and get an offer, Bloomberg will fly you out for a 3-day networking event—everything’s covered. A few months before your internship starts, you’ll get a form to choose your preferred team, but note that there’s no guarantee you’ll land exactly where you picked.

4. **Compensation & Benefits**
    
    We cannot disclose salaries & bonuses but we can state that you won't need to avoid shops like Chanel, Hermes or Versace anymore. As Bloomberg is not listed stocks are not on the table.

5. **Post-Internship Opportunities**
    
    One of the cool things about Bloomberg is that if you stand out during your internship, they might invite you back for a second one—this time, you can choose between New York and London. They also offer full-time roles after graduation, so it’s a great long-term opportunity if things go well.
