# Google Internship STEP/SWE (2025)

## General Overview
Google offers world-class software internships and drives innovation in areas like search, cloud computing, and machine learning.
This guide is written by students for students, sharing firsthand experiences of Google internships including STEP and SWE positions. The information is based on personal experiences and insights from current interns.

This guide covers:
1. How to get a Google STEP / SWE internship
2. Other internship opportunities
3. Tips for securing return offers

### Why Choose Google?
- **Impactful Projects:** Interns work on real products that reach billions, from Search to Android to Cloud.
- **STEP Program:** Unique to Google, STEP offers tailored support for early-year students, focusing on growth and potential.
- **Mentorship-Driven:** Internships emphasize strong mentorship, feedback, and personal development.
- **Engineering Culture:** A collaborative, curious, and intellectually honest environment where asking questions is encouraged.
- **Pathway to Full-Time:** High return offer rates and well-defined conversion paths for successful interns.

### Differences between SWE and STEP interns

## Hiring Process

### Interview Process
**1. Application Submission**
**1. Online Assessment (OA)**
**2. Technical Interview x 2**
**3. Intern Placement Interview Stage (Project Placement)**

#### Application Submission
- You can find successful CVs [here](./CV_Templates).

#### Online Assessment
- This round consists of 2 easy-medium (mostly easy) leetcode style questions.
- Write test cases for your code in their notepad, with given and expected I/O.
- Google uses self-written tests (unlike other FAANG companies). Make sure to add a lot of them when you are taking it.
- Be prepared to explain time and space complexity with a simple small comment. It helps when they check the solution. (not mandatory)
- Focus on problem-solving approach rather than optimization. The problem must work first.

#### Technical Interview (SWE Intern)
- All technical interviews are 45 minutes leetcode style problems, out of which there are two back-to-back they are usually **medium-hard** in difficulty and you can exprect dynamic programming. Try not to go over time in the first interview, but you can if the interviewer wants to go over time in the second.
- At Google, the approach is slightly different. Engineers focus not just on your coding skills but also on how you think. For example, I once got a dynamic programming question. While I didn’t know DP well enough to implement the optimal solution at the time, I clearly explained my thought process, demonstrated a strong understanding of the concepts, and worked through a non-optimal approach. I didn’t finish the code on time, but I still got the offer, because they valued my reasoning and problem-solving more than just getting to the final answer.

#### Technical Interview (STEP Intern)

#### Project Placement Strategy
- Google has an internal "marketplace" for interns, where your CV is posted and managers around the world (or where you applied) are able to see it, if they think you could be a good add-on to the team, your recruiter will send you an email to schedule a call with your potential host. If both you (yes, your opinion matters at this stage) and your host agree to work togheter, you are all set! Offer incoming!
- This is a non-technical interview, but make sure to document yourself well about the team and what they are doing before jumping in.
- Prioritize offices with higher hiring rates.
- Poland and Romania offices are recommended for maximizing chances.
- Consider office location impact on return offer prospects. In Zurich or London, having a return offer is going to be much more complicated as time goes on.

## Recommendations
### LeetCode Preparation
- Focus on array/string problems
- Try to get the basics done https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/
- Key topics to master:
  - HASH MAPS
  - Two pointers
  - Sliding windows
  - Heaps
  - Running sum
  - Dynamic programming
  - Backtracking
  - Greedy algorithms
  - BST, AVL, Graphs (DFS, BFS should do, nothing like Tarjan or anything hardcore)
  - Classic Stack / Queue problems

Note: I have heard of dozens of Google interns having received **AT LEAST** one problem where they have to optimize it with a Hash Map or some sort of memoization. Put a lot of effort into knowing what happens behind the scenes and motivate the use of your data structures well during the interview process.

### Important Notes
- Do not panic if the interviewer does not show up; it's a common courtesy of Google. Multiple friends have had this happen to them, even to me.
- Google really likes their tests, so make sure you spend some time testing your solution against a lot of edge cases and always talk during the interview about testing and how you cover edge cases.
- STEP interviews typically don't include graph or tree problems. From the 10 STEP interns in Zurich 2024, 0 have received something like this.
- Interviewers are more lenient with mistakes and provide more guidance to interns by default -- even MORE at STEP, but it really also depends on the luck from the interviewer. Nonetheless, **make sure you mention you are here for STEP and you are in the 2nd year out of 4** as they usually are unaware of this.
- Performance optimization is less critical - focus on getting working solutions. Greedy and Backtracking should be able to work on almost any problem.
- Python is recommended due to its simplicity and efficiency. You also do not want to spend time debugging code during the interview.
- My Golden Rule: **Talk more, write less**. During all my interviews, I always tend to solve the problem with code only after I have 100% solved it with words and with the interviewer. Never "vibe code" a solution before talking ALL the details with the interviewer. You will see that "figuring it out as you go" does not work. All you want to do when you write the code is do it quick - 5 to 10 minutes - and then think together with the interviewer about all the edge cases, about how it can be improved, but never spend time on nit details during the first 20 minutes. You need to get something to work first. Draw the solution, write comments, clarify everything you can before you go into the code.

### Perfect Technical Interview and How I See It

1. You get to know the person, tell them a bit about yourself, goals, aspirations, and why you are there. Establish some kind of connection.
2. Get the question and read it together with the interviewer, not alone. They now watch for GPT users, so I tend to get in front of the camera and gesticulate with my arms or have them visible so they know I am actually reading with them and thinking about the problem.
3. Get the I/O expectations right - given what input you have to do what, the happy scenario only. Get a solution verbally for that one first and make the interviewer agree or not with it.
4. Code the happy flow solution first with the easiest possible way if the optimal one does not come to mind. Even if it does, I usually still first do it with backtracking or greedy so that they get excited when I "improve" my solution :)
5. Only after you have something working and tested on the happy flow, deal with the edge cases. Usually, this is much easier once you get something good to work with.
6. End on a positive note. They usually offer to stay and get questions from you if you have them. If you have time during your first interview, do it. If it is the second, you MUST do it, as you surely have the time.

NOTE: They do not make a decision directly. They write down what they remember about you and how you did, giving you scores. You must sound like a capable and friendly person to the hiring manager that will make the actual decision of hiring you or not based on their feedback.

## Company insights

### Office Locations and Hiring Trends
- **High-Hiring Offices (40-50 positions/year)**:
  - Warsaw & Krakow 
  - Zurich
  - London
  - Munich

- **Medium-Hiring Offices (3-5 positions/year)**:
  - Bucharest (Going up to 10 interns in some years)
  - Stockholm
  - Berlin
  - Milano

Note: Big offices are generally reliable but have seen decreasing intern positions over the years. Other than Warsaw & Krakow lately, the Zurich, London, and Munich offices have seen a huge decrease in interns. Keep in mind that in High-Hiring offices you have better chances to get a position, if you are in Intern Placement Interview stage.
