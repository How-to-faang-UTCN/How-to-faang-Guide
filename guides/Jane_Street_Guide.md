 ## Hiring Process
 Jane Street's hiring process is notoriously selective. The main steps include:
 
 1. **Application Submission**
 2. **Online Technical Interview (1 Round)**
 3. **Onsite Superday (3 Rounds)**
 4. **Response**
 
 ### Application Submission
 - **IMPORTANT:** Jane Street is **very** selective at this stage. They often recruit from target schools, so without a strong CV, you may be overlooked. However, participating in contests such as the **ACM ICPC** or other prestigious competitive programming/maths competitions can boost your chances. They usually sponsor the [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.global/) starting from the [SEERC](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/SEERC) stage, and participants may be invited to interview afterwards.
 - **Timing:** Applications open around late **August** to early **September**. Apply **ASAP** to maximize your chances.
 - **CV Tips:**
   - Ensure your CV is strong and attention-grabbing.
   - Keep it concise (ideally 1-2 pages).
   - Use a classic template, such as the [Harvard template](https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/bullet-point-resume-template/).
   - **Avoid:** Fancy or overly colorful designs that might not scan well.
 
 ### Online Technical Interview
 - **Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes.
 - **Structure:**
   - **Coding Challenge Only:** Expect a particular style of coding problems (see [Jane Street Problems](#jane-street-problems)).
   - **Q&A:** A short slot to ask questions. Prepare a few quality questions that genuinely interest you, as this can boost your chances.
 
 ### Onsite Superday
 - **Duration:** Three rounds, each lasting about 45 minutes.
 - **Structure:**
   - **Coding Challenge Only:** Similar in style to the online interview, but with two interviewers per round.
   - **Q&A:** A brief opportunity to ask questions, similar to the online round.
 
 ### Response
 - **Very Fast:** Jane Street tends to move quickly, typically providing a response within 1 or 2 days after each stage. During the onsite superday, if performance in the first two rounds is poor, rejection may be given on the sport, without getting to the 3rd round.
 - **Prepare Ahead:** If you target Jane Street, be "in shape" before they contact you. Once invited to interview, the **ENTIRE** process is often completed within 1-2 weeks, leaving little time to cram. (In my case, they contacted me in the middle of an exam session and flew me out immediately after my last exam, so your training plan should account for unexpected timing)
 
 ### Jane Street Problems
 This section is dedicated to Jane Street’s unique approach to coding challenges:
 
 - Generally, they do not involve complex algorithms (e.g. advanced graph algorithms, hard dynamic programming), however they rely a lot on **data structures** and efficient data management. You must have a **strong** understanding of hash-maps, sets, and other common containers defined in your language of choice.
 - The problems involve a **game-like** or **real-world** scenario (e.g. modified connect four, modified trading bot). Generally, they give you some tasks that your class should accomplish while (*sometimes*) communicating with some external API's (some mock function declarations). Even though the logic behind the problems is not complicated, they expect to see how you design a class, how you store and access the data efficiently, how you structure the code, and how clean and fast you can do it. 
 - The way each interview question is structured is that they start off with a really simple problem that you should finish quite fast. Afterwards, they keep adding increasingly complex requirements to the problem. My impression was that they attempt to overload you to see how you well you adapt under the pressure. The problems themselves are **NOT** that hard, so you should be as **relaxed** as possible while interviewing with them. 
 - The interview is **language agnostic**; you will write your code in a Google Docs-style environment without the ability to run it.  
 - **Keep talking!** Communication is key, so you have to keep your interviewer engaged with what you are doing and what you approach is. The interviewer wants to find out how easy it is to work with you.
 - Focus on writing **clean, easy-to-read code** and be ready to manually test cases.  
 - Always discuss the time and space complexity (Big O notation).  
 - Prioritize code quality and readability over overly optimized but less clear solutions.
 - **Note:** Avoid using languages like OCaml merely to impress—the goal is clarity and effectiveness in solving the problem.
 
 ## Recommendations
 - **KEEP COOL:** Despite their intimidating aura, their problems are not that hard. Once you get to the interview stage, be confident in your abilities and don't lose your head. They wouldn't have given you an interview if they didn't think you were up to the challenge.
 - **Diversified Practice:** Solve as many problems as possible, from different sources. Do not focus on Leetcode only (even their Jane Street problem list is innacurate in my opinion). Their problems are not something that you will find elsewhere, so don't try to memorise solutions.
 - **Mock interview:** Convince your most cracked friend to interview you and try to stump and overload you. Jane Street will put you to the test, so make sure you keep cool under pressure.
 - **Be Prepared:** They move quickly and might contact you unexpectedly (see [Application Submission](#application-submission) section). Stay consistently prepared and ready to interview at short notice.
 - **Focus Your Preparation:** Do **NOT** spend excessive time on high-level system design, design patterns, and networking as they are  rarely part of the Jane Street internship hiring process. **Some** language questions might come up if the interviewer knows the language you are using.
