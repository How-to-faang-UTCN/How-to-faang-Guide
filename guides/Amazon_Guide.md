# Amazon SWE Internship 
 
 ## General Overview
 
 Amazon offers both 3-month and 6-month SWE internships across various locations, including Dublin, Berlin, Madrid, Iasi, and more. Applications are submitted via the official [careers page](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/).
 
 ### Why Choose Amazon?
 - **Strong Internship Program:** A well-structured program with clearly planned projects.
 - **Prestigious Brand:** A reputable name on your CV.
 - **Multiple Locations:** Choose from several locations (note: popular sites such as Dublin tend to fill quickly).
 - **Relocation Stipend:** Financial support for moving, though typically smaller than some other Big Tech companies.
 - **"Classic" Interview Process:** Even if you aren't particularly attracted to the company, their hiring style is very similar to a lot of major players in the industry.
 
 ## Hiring Process
 
 Amazon’s hiring process for SWE internships is streamlined and similar to other Big Tech companies. The main steps are:
 
 1. **Application Submission**
 2. **Online Assessment**
 3. **Technical Interview (1 Round)**
 4. **Response within 5 Days**
 
 ### Application Submission
 - **Timing:** Applications open around early **September**. Apply **ASAP** to maximize your chances.
 - **CV Tips:**  
   - Submit an OCR-friendly, concise CV (ideally 1-2 pages).  
   - Use a classic template, like the [Harvard template](https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/bullet-point-resume-template/).  
   - **Avoid:** Fancy or overly colorful designs that might not scan well.
 
 ### Online Assessment (OA)
 - **Format:** Consists of 2 easy/medium Leetcode-style problems.
 - **Preparation:** Aim for a perfect score at this stage, since anything less will significantly reduce your chances of landing an interview. If you have difficulty with solving such OA's, you should **STRONGLY** prioritize leetcode/codeforces problems during your preparation. 
 
 ### Technical Interview
 - **Duration:** Approximately 45 minutes.
 - **Structure:**  
   - **Behavioral Questions:** Expect questions based on Amazon’s [leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles). Prepare specific examples from your background that align with these principles.  
   - **Coding Challenge:** A standard Leetcode problem (easy/medium) followed by a potential harder follow-up.  
 - **Coding Guidelines:**  
   - Your **end goal** is not to solve the problem perfectly, but rather to demonstrate your ability to develop quality software. 
   - Do **NOT** lose your cool if you get lost in the solving process. Being able to adapt based on the interviewer's hints is a big plus, as long as you don't rely too much on them.
   - **Keep talking!** Communication is key, so you have to keep your interviewer engaged with what you are doing and what you approach is. The interviewer wants to find out how easy it is to work with you.
   - The interview is **language agnostic**; you will write your code in a Google Docs-style environment without the ability to run it.  
   - Focus on writing **clean, easy-to-read code** and be ready to manually test cases.  
   - Always discuss the time and space complexity (Big O notation).  
   - Prioritize code quality and readability over overly optimized but less clear solutions.
 
 ### Response Timeline
 - Amazon typically provides a response within 5 days post-interview. In cases of wait-listing, updates may take longer.
 
 ## Recommendations
 
 - **Build a Strong CV:**  
   - Ensure it’s concise and eye-catching.  
   - Even if reviewed by an automated system initially, a human reviewer may eventually see it, but won't spend more than a few minutes reading it.
 - **Practice Practice Practice Coding Problems:**  
   - **Leetcode** contains almost the *exact* problems you will encounter, so it is a very valuable resource.
   - **Codeforces** is also a great place to improve your coding speed and thinking under pressure, but the problems are generally much harder. **Speed** and **quick thinking** are very valuable skills to have in these types of interviews.
 - **Emphasize Code Quality:**  
   - Always focus on writing clean, maintainable code.
 - **Understand Amazon’s Leadership Principles:**  
   - Incorporate them into your behavioral responses; they’re more than just buzzwords.
 - **Focus Your Preparation:**  
   - Do **NOT** spend excessive time on system design, design patterns, or language-specific questions—they are rarely part of the Amazon internship hiring process.
