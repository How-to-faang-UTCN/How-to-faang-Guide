# Revolut – Rev-celerator Internship Guide

## General Overview

Revolut is a global financial technology company that provides a wide range of digital banking services such as current accounts, currency exchange, budgeting tools, debit cards, and investment features. It operates in multiple countries and is known for its data-driven, performance-oriented culture. Engineering plays a central role in building and scaling the platform.

## Why Revolut?

Revolut offers a fast-paced, high-growth environment where interns are given real responsibilities from day one. The Rev-celerator Internship is structured to provide both technical and professional development, with clear expectations and feedback. Interns work alongside full-time engineers on production-level systems, and those who perform well may receive return offers for graduate roles. If you're looking to be challenged and learn quickly in a competitive setting, Revolut is a strong option.

## Program Overview

- **Application timeline**: Starts in September; the interview process typically concludes by early January.
- **Internship period**: A 10-week summer internship, generally starting in early July. The internship dates are **fixed**, and there's no flexibility around starting or ending times.
- **Eligibility**: Open to students in their penultimate year.
- **Roles offered**: Backend Java Developer, Backend Python Developer and Frontend.
- **Locations**: For the Java role, the locations in the last year were Portugal, Spain, and Poland.
- **Conversion**: Interns may be considered for a graduate offer upon successful completion of the internship.

## Application Process

### 1. Online Assessment (HackerRank)

- Duration: ~90 minutes
- Format: Two medium-level coding problems similar to those on LeetCode.
- Topics: Standard algorithms and data structures.


### 2. Recruiter Screen Call Interview

- Format: This is a casual, 20–30 minute discussion with a recruiter, and it’s not a technical interview. 
- Content:
  - You’ll be asked some basic questions like why you applied to Revolut and why you chose that particular role (Java, Python, or Frontend). 
  - You’ll also be asked to describe a situation where you demonstrated one of Revolut’s values. While these values will be shared with you during the call, it’s helpful to read about them and prepare some real-life examples beforehand.
  - There might also be a brief chat about location preferences and what is the salary in that place.
- Note: This interview is not eliminatory. Regardless of your performance during this interview, you will receive an invitation to schedule your technical interview.

### 3. Technical Interview

- Format: The final step is a technical interview that lasts around an hour and is split into two parts: a System Design Problem and a Theoretical Discussion Part.
- Structure:
  - **Part 1 – System Design (30 minutes)**:
		- You’ll be asked to design a basic data structure, such as a `HashMap` or `HashSet`. 
		- The interviewer will expect you to explain how it works under the hood—so make sure you understand how these structures are implemented internally. 
		- You'll also need to justify time and space complexities for different operations and he might possibly walk through specific lines of code and ask what they do.

  - **Part 2 – Technical & Theoretical Questions (30 minutes)**:
		- This part focuses on general software engineering knowledge. 
		- Some of the topics you might encounter include:
			- Core data structures and algorithms questions
			- Concurrency concepts
			- SOLID principles
			- ACID properties in databases
			- Software development lifecycle
			- Best practices before and after writing code
			- Clean code and good design principles
			- What to look for in code reviews
			
## More Info & Recommendations

- It helps to start preparing early, especially for the coding assessment. Practicing medium-difficulty problems on LeetCode or HackerRank should be enough.
- Make sure you understand how basic data structures work. For the system design section, focus on simple components like hashmaps, sets, queues, and how they might be implemented.
- Be familiar with Revolut’s core values. You don’t need to memorize them, but have a real example ready where you demonstrated one of them in a project, team, or work setting.
- The technical interview touches on broad software engineering concepts. You don’t need deep expertise, but be ready to explain what you know clearly and with reasoning.
- Don’t worry too much about the recruiter call — it’s not eliminatory. Be honest, know why you’re applying, and stay professional.
- There’s usually a few weeks between each stage, so be patient and use that time to review and practice.
