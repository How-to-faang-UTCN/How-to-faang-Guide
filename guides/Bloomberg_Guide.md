### B. How to apply:
Bloomberg’s recruitment process is somewhat exclusive. The application link isn’t publicly available; you typically need to attend one of their events or be lucky enough to get contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn. Keep an eye on events hosted at UBB and UPB. The application window typically opens around September–October (or earlier). 

### C. Recruitment process (2024 — Cluj-Napoca):
> **Note: This is a <span style="color:#fd5c63; font-weight:bold;">STAGE-GATED</span> process that typically takes <span style="color:#fd5c63; font-weight:bold;">1–2 months</span>.
After completing the online stages, notifications may arrive anywhere from 1 day to 1 week — don't worry if it takes a bit longer.
For in-person interviews, you will usually receive an email notification within 20 minutes of finishing the interview.**


1.  **Screening**    
    
    After obtaining the application link, you must submit your resume. Your application then undergoes an initial screening.

2. **Interviews**

    Make sure you're honest, know your work well, and be prepared to discuss it in detail. <span style="color:#fd5c63; font-weight:bold;">Avoid lies</span> on your resume (e.g., claiming 6 months of experience when you actually have 3), as Bloomberg conducts <span style="color:#fd5c63; font-weight:bold;">background checks</span> after hiring and discrepancies may be uncovered. 

    From what I’ve seen and heard, cultural fit is also very important to them. Every stage of the process includes some level of assessment focused on whether you'd be a good match for their team and values. 

    All coding interviews are done on HackerRank. You can use whatever programming language you're comfortable with—it doesn’t impact the process. They usually don’t run the code live, but that doesn’t mean your code shouldn’t work. Minor mistakes are okay, so don’t stress.

    - **Interview I:** 
        - **Format:** Online (Phone Call/Zoom), 1h
        - **Focus:** Algorithms   
   - **Interview II:** 
        - **Format:** In person/Online Zoom, 1h, 2 interviewers 
        - **Focus:** Algorithms  
            > *Interviews I and II typically include LeetCode or HackerRank-style problems. The difficulty can range from easy to hard, depending on how lucky you are -karma is a bitch-. After solving the initial problem(s), you may be asked follow-up questions such as how to parallelize your solution, analyze trade-offs between memory and time complexity, handle edge cases, or adapt to new constraints. These follow-ups are designed to assess your problem-solving approach and depth of understanding. I would recommended to prepare using LeetCode, especially the company-tagged problems available with a premium plan.* 

   - **Interview III:** 
        - **Format:** In person/Online Zoom, 1h
        - **Focus:** System design.
            > *This interview is different—it focuses on how you approach the design of large-scale systems. You'll be expected to demonstrate your understanding of concepts such as scalability, load balancing, caching, databases, and fault tolerance. You won't be required to write actual code, instead, their focus is on your thought process, architectural decisions, and communication. You'll either sketch your ideas using a whiteboard or pen and paper. Don’t worry—there is no correct answer!*

   - **Interview IV:** 
        - **Format:** Online Zoom, 30'
        - **Focus:** Behavioural
            > *In this interview, you'll speak with an HR representative. It’s a typical behavioral interview, where you'll be asked questions about teamwork, past experiences, how you handle various situations etc.. You should also expect questions that assess cultural fit, motivation, and your ability to navigate different workplace scenarios.*
   - **Interview V - Big Boss:**
        - **Format:** Online Zoom, 1h
        - **Focus:** Behavioural
            > *In this final interview, you'll speak with a technical manager about your background, career goals, and your resume. While the conversation is primarily focused on getting to know you, there's a possibility you may be asked system design or algorithmic questions.*

## Company Insights
1. **Offer Stage:** Once you successfully make it through the recruitment process and get an offer, a few months before your internship starts, you’ll get a form to choose your preferred team, but note that there’s no guarantee you’ll land exactly where you picked.

2. **Compensation & Benefits:** High salaries & bonuses. Bloomberg is not listed, so stock options are not part of the compensation package.

3. **Post-Internship Opportunities:** One of the cool things about Bloomberg is that if you stand out during your internship, they might invite you back for a second one—this time, you can choose between New York and London. They also offer full-time roles after graduation, so it’s a great long-term opportunity if things go well.

## Recommendations

1. **Personal touch**

    Even though it was a long process, I genuinely enjoyed the recruitment experience. Bloomberg stands out as one of the few companies that truly went beyond just testing whether you’re a memoization machine. I especially appreciated their in-person interviews.

    The one that stuck with me the most was the system design interview. I had the chance to sit down with a senior engineer, side by side, sketching things out on paper. For the first 20 minutes, we just talked—about Bloomberg, about myself. What really impressed me was how, instead of staying on the usual surface-level topics from my resume (which was mostly AI—outside his domain), he went much deeper. He asked about convolutional layers, how features are built hierarchically—stuff that tells you something about how someone thinks. Even though the interview was about system design, I got the feeling he wanted to understand the kind of person he was talking to. Are you thoughtful? Do you actually understand things? Or are you just skimming?

    Every interaction I had with them felt genuinely human. The interviews weren’t rushed. Not once did I feel like someone was watching the clock or waiting for me to slip up—unlike a certain AI company in Switzerland (no names here), where the interviewer barely said hi before launching into a checklist of questions like he was in a hurry to be somewhere else. Everyone’s experience is different, and don’t forget—the interview is also your chance to see if you want to work with them.
