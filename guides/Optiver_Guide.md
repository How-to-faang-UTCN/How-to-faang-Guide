## About Optiver

Optiver is a company from The Netheerlands specializing in high-frequencies trading, being a market maker. 
Related to the expectation they have, they put accent on being more then a coder, being able to come up with architectural solutin for the problems you try to solve.    
The intership takes place in Amsterdam, and it spans across 8 weeks.

## Hiring process

The hiring process at Optiver is somehow tidious and long. It takes place usually starting from september/october so be sure to follow the start of the application window. The good part is that the feedback usually comes fast, even though is not specific, i.e., they don't specify why they reject you just that you have been rejected.

### 1. Online Assesment
After you apply you will be given an online assesment, which consists of 2 problems. The complexity of the problems is not that high and I recomend python for writing the code as the problems are usually involving some work with hash maps(in python dictionaries).

Following those problems you will have to play some games that test:
- reaction time: click on the screen a certain shape, or click  arrows that indicate the type of objects;
- quick thinking: given 4 numbers use mathematical operation to obtain a certain number;
- strategy: pump air in a balloon that has a chance of poping(try to observe when does the balloon is most likely to pop and try to pump air untill that value);
- pattern recognition: try to gues a card by consecutevily guessing combinations of color, shape and number.

From the online assesment part the games were the most stressing because there is no way of knowing what a good score is.
### 2. The Interview process
The interview process consists of 4 steps:   

- **First behavioural interview**: Usually this interview consist of just general questions about you and your CV.    

- **A tech screening**: Consist of 3 questions, in my case they were: A data structure one (trying to see how I will create a data structure that stores data that does not fit on normal types), a language feature question(compare python with c++), a system design question(design an app and then scale it). Unfortunately the I overcomplicated the system design question and that is why I was rejected after this round.  

- **Two technical interviews**: an Algorithmic one and a System Design one. As I didn't get this far I cannot say for sure what will come but based on intuition and other interviews,  the first will contain probably some tasks in which they will test your Data Structure and Algorithms and the Software Design which will probably start with something simple and then ask you to scale it.   

- **Another behavioural interview**: probably similar to what other companies do, i.e., answear how would you behave in a certain scenario.
