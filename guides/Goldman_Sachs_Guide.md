# Goldman Sachs SWE Internship

## General Overview

Goldman Sachs offers Software Engineering internships, including the typical 10-week summer program and longer off-cycle opportunities. Key European locations often include London, Warsaw, Frankfurt, and Zurich, although specific availability varies each year (Note: The Hague is less common for SWE roles compared to other divisions). All applications should be submitted through the official [Goldman Sachs Careers page](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers), which provides the most up-to-date information on programs and available locations.

### Why Choose Goldman Sachs over Big Tech?
- **Unique Intersection of Finance & Technology:** Goldman Sachs is a financial institution that prides itself with their focus on engineering and strong technical culture.
- **Solve High-Stakes, Critical Problems:** Go beyond optimizing user engagement or scaling platforms; build and maintain mission-critical systems managing significant financial risk, processing high-value transactions, and ensuring global market stability.
- **Develop Specialized Domain Expertise:** Gain knowledge of financial products, market dynamics, algorithmic trading, and other financial aspects (depending on the team) alongside the direct technical skills, a combination less common in traditional tech internships.
- **Direct Exposure to Products:** Contribute directly to a production environment. In contrast to the traditional Big Tech internship, interns typically work alongside the team on their actual tasks.
- **Broader Career Optionality:** Build a versatile foundation that opens doors not only to competitive tech companies but also to elite roles in FinTech, hedge funds, and leadership positions within global finance.
- **Competitive Compensation and Benefits:** GS offers a very strong compensation package for their internships.

## Hiring Process

Goldman's application process differs significantly from many tech firms, with a stronger emphasis on behavioral questions and deep dives into your CV. However, Goldman Sachs often has a slower hiring process, so do not panic if you experience periods of silence (even weeks or months) between stages.

1.  **Application Submission**
2.  **Online Assessment (OA)**
3.  **Recorded Interview (e.g. HireVue)**
4.  **Final "Superday" Interviews**
5.  **Offer within a few weeks**

### Application Submission
 - **Timing:** Applications open around early **September**. Apply **ASAP** to maximize your chances.
 - **CV Tips:**  
   - The Goldman Sachs interview process revolves **A LOT** around your CV, so make it strong.
   - Submit an OCR-friendly, concise CV (ideally 1-2 pages).  
   - Use a classic template, like the [Harvard template](https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/bullet-point-resume-template/).  
   - **Avoid:** Fancy or overly colorful designs that might not scan well.

### Online Assessment
 - **Format:** Consists of 2 easy/medium Leetcode-style problems.
 - **Preparation:** Aim for a perfect score at this stage, since anything less will significantly reduce your chances of landing an interview. If you have difficulty with solving such OA's, you should **STRONGLY** prioritize leetcode/codeforces problems during your preparation. 

### Recorded Interview (e.g., HireVue)
 - **Format:** You will record yourself answering questions that appear on screen. Most questions are behavioral, focusing on hypothetical situations or past experiences (using the STAR method is recommended). They are generally not specific to your CV at this stage. Technical questions, if any, are usually conceptual and brief.
 - **Preparation:** Practice answering behavioral questions out loud. Prepare 2-3 versatile examples from your past experiences (projects, teamwork, challenges) using the STAR method, which you can adapt on the spot. Rehearse concise and clear delivery.

### Final Superday Interviews
- **Format:**  Interviews heavily emphasize your CV and past experiences, often involving deep dives into your listed projects. While coding exercises might be less frequent or styled differently than in Big Tech (e.g., focusing on code review, debugging, or high-level design related to your CV), do not assume zero technical or coding components. The format varies by team and interviewer. Interviews are often free-flowing discussions, switching between behavioral and technical questions.
- **Duration:** Consists of 2 back-to-back interviews, approx. 45 minutes each.  
- **Structure:**
    - **Behavioral Questions:** Expect questions focusing on teamwork, project planning, handling challenges, motivation, and alignment with Goldman Sachs' values.
    - **Technical Questions:** Primarily tests your understanding of technologies and concepts listed on your CV. Questions are often conceptual or design-oriented (e.g., "Why did you choose X technology for this project?", "How does Y protocol work generally?", "Tell me about your experience with Z cloud services") rather than deep implementation details (unless you claimed deep expertise).

### Response Timeline
- The response timeline after the Superday can vary significantly, potentially taking several weeks. Be prepared for a longer wait compared to some other firms, and don't hesitate to follow up politely if you haven't heard back after the timeframe they might have indicated.

## Recommendations

 - **Build a Strong CV:**  
   - Your CV is crucial. Ensure it's concise, highlights relevant projects/experiences compellingly, and that you can discuss everything on it confidently and in detail.
   - Financial knowledge is generally not required for SWE roles, although basic business awareness is a plus.
 - **Master Behavioural Questions:**
   - Practice articulating your experiences clearly using the STAR method. Eloquence, structured thinking, and clear communication are highly valued.
   - Prepare a few generic scenarios that can be tailored quickly to the question at hand.
   - If caught off-guard, you can take a brief moment (5-10 seconds) to structure your thoughts, but practice thinking on your feet to maintain the conversation's flow.
