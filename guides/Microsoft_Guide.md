# Microsoft SWE Internship 

## General Overview
Microsoft is one of the pioneers of technology in the area of software and computing, having created Windows OS, Microsoft Office, Azure core and owns Github, Linkdin, Visual studio just to name a few. Microsoft interns mainly use C# and Dotnet and will get the opportunity to work on Microsoft products suc as Azure core or Teams. The bucharest office focuses solely on Azure core and software adjacent to it. 

Microsoft does not provide housing or free food, but does have a very generous relocation package, which you won't be able to spend unless you get a mansion for the summer. 

### Why Choose Microsoft?

- **Likely to get return offer:** Compared to other companies, Microsoft seems to have a higher return offer rate, meaning that you are very likely to get one at the end of the summer. If you want to become a cloud developer, Microsoft Bucharest might the easiest entry which also has good money.
- **Internal flexibility:** One of the interviewers we spoke to transitioned from project manager to software developer. When we asked about Microsoft involvement and acceptance of this change, they said that Microsoft will do everything which is in their power to support such a change if they can. For example if you want to transition to robotics, they can't do much since they don't have any such projects, but if you want to change roles between pm, backend, frontend, cloud / etc they will support you.
- **Classic FAANG perks:** High salary (although Microsoft is on the lower spectrum compared to other FAANGS), prestige, etc

## Hiring Process

Consists of three stages:
- **Application screening**
- **Online assessment**
- **3 back-to-back interviews**

### Application Submission and screening

Microsoft is a bit of black hole for us in this respect, since some people who had several years of work experience and a were rejected, while others with only projects (albeit good ones) were accepted as well as high-school olympics. 

All in all, Microsoft seem to be looking for "geeks", people with strong technical in more unusual settings and outside the box technical abilities, which would justify why work experience is not valuable for them, but edgy projects and olympiads are.

### Online Assessment

This is possibly the hardest online assessment of all the FAANG companies. If you pass the OA without cheating, you can basically consider yourself 90% in. There are two problems, one easy/medium leetcode and another medium/hard problem. The latter is unusual and involves some out of the box thinking. Some topics for the second problem may include backtracking, mathematical induction, priority queues or dynamic programming. 

The OA platform is Codility and, unlike other companies, Microsoft allows you to browse the web, code in your IDE and so on, with a complete disregard for cheating for some reason. The time to complete both problems is 75 minutes.

### Technical Interview (SWE Intern)

Microsoft has one of the most *fair* interviews. There are 3 back-to-back interviews, meaning in the same day, you will have 3 interviews with 3 different people one after another. Even if you bomb one of the interviews or get unlucky with the interviewers, you can still do well on the other two and get in. 

Each interview will include a behavioral stage, a Leetcode stage and possibly a general programming stage. 
- **Behavioral:** You will be asked generic questions such as "tell us a time where you disagreed with a teammate and how it solutioned" or or questions from your CV. Everything from your CV is fair game to ask and you are expected to be able to explain your projects. 
- **Leetcode:** If you solved both problems of the OA, you should breeze through this one. You can expect easy or medium problems, which are well-known or reasonable. 
- **General programming:** Depending on the interviewer, you might also get asked some general programming questions such as tell me what OOP principles you know. Don't expect anything crazy and if you did well on leetcode, this part shouldn't affect your chances too much.


At the end of your interview you will get the chance to ask Microsoft engineers any questions about their jobs or whatever uncertainty you have.

## Other info

- You will get fast responses and offers. You will find out in 1-2 days if you passed the interviews 
- Microsoft actually sends rejection emails, so you shouldn't have the ghosting issue.
