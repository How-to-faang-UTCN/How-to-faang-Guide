 ## Hiring Process
 
 ### Interview Process
 **1. Application Submission**
 **1. Online Assessment (OA)**
 **2. Technical Interview x 2**
 **3. Intern Placement Interview Stage (Project Placement)**
 
 #### Application Submission

 - You can find successful CVs here [Content to be added].
 
 #### Online Assessment
 - This round consists of 2 easy-medium (mostly easy) leetcode style questions.
 - Write test cases for your code in their notepad, with given and expected I/O.
 - Google uses self-written tests (unlike other FAANG companies). Make sure to add a lot of them when you are taking it.
 - Be prepared to explain time and space complexity with a simple small comment. It helps when they check the solution. (not mandatory)
 - Focus on problem-solving approach rather than optimization. The problem must work first.
 
 #### Technical Interview (SWE Intern)
 - All technical interviews are 45 minutes leetcode style problems, out of which there are two back-to-back they are usually **medium-hard** in difficulty and you can exprect dynamic programming. Try not to go over time in the first interview, but you can if the interviewer wants to go over time in the second.
 - At Google, the approach is slightly different. Engineers focus not just on your coding skills but also on how you think. For example, I once got a dynamic programming question. While I didn’t know DP well enough to implement the optimal solution at the time, I clearly explained my thought process, demonstrated a strong understanding of the concepts, and worked through a non-optimal approach. I didn’t finish the code on time, but I still got the offer, because they valued my reasoning and problem-solving more than just getting to the final answer.
 
 #### Technical Interview (STEP Intern)

 #### Project Placement Strategy
 - Google has an internal "marketplace" for interns, where your CV is posted and managers around the world (or where you applied) are able to see it, if they think you could be a good add-on to the team, your recruiter will send you an email to schedule a call with your potential host. If both you (yes, your opinion matters at this stage) and your host agree to work togheter, you are all set! Offer incoming!
 - This is a non-technical interview, but make sure to document yourself well about the team and what they are doing before jumping in.
 - Prioritize offices with higher hiring rates.
 - Poland and Romania offices are recommended for maximizing chances.
 - Consider office location impact on return offer prospects. In Zurich or London, having a return offer is going to be much more complicated as time goes on.
 
 ## Recommendations

 1. You get to know the person, tell them a bit about yourself, goals, aspirations, and why you are there. Establish some kind of connection.
 2. Get the question and read it together with the interviewer, not alone. They now watch for GPT users, so I tend to get in front of the camera and gesticulate with my arms or have them visible so they know I am actually reading with them and thinking about the problem.
 3. Get the I/O expectations right - given what input you have to do what, the happy scenario only. Get a solution verbally for that one first and make the interviewer agree or not with it.
 4. Code the happy flow solution first with the easiest possible way if the optimal one does not come to mind. Even if it does, I usually still first do it with backtracking or greedy so that they get excited when I "improve" my solution :)
 5. Only after you have something working and tested on the happy flow, deal with the edge cases. Usually, this is much easier once you get something good to work with.
 6. End on a positive note. They usually offer to stay and get questions from you if you have them. If you have time during your first interview, do it. If it is the second, you MUST do it, as you surely have the time.
 
 NOTE: They do not make a decision directly. They write down what they remember about you and how you did, giving you scores. You must sound like a capable and friendly person to the hiring manager that will make the actual decision of hiring you or not based on their feedback.
 
 ## Company insights
 
 ### Office Locations and Hiring Trends
 - **High-Hiring Offices (40-50 positions/year)**:
   - Warsaw & Krakow 
   - Zurich
   - London
   - Munich
 
 - **Medium-Hiring Offices (3-5 positions/year)**:
   - Bucharest (Going up to 10 interns in some years)
   - Stockholm
   - Berlin
   - Milano
 
 Note: Big offices are generally reliable but have seen decreasing intern positions over the years. Other than Warsaw & Krakow lately, the Zurich, London, and Munich offices have seen a huge decrease in interns. Keep in mind that in High-Hiring offices you have better chances to get a position, if you are in Intern Placement Interview stage.
