This is a full guide on how to get into a **prestigious, well-paid, international company** from UTCN (or any romanian college for that matter). The term FAANG originated from big tech giants, but is now more of an umbrella term for prestigious companies. 
This guide goes through the full proces of building and writing a strong CV, passing screening and online assessments, nailing your interviews and finally getting an offer. 
We present both generic and company-specific info, as well as **recent real life stories** with both successes and failures and how ridiculous the market can be right now. Enjoy.

## Why Faang?
Why should you choose a FAANG company ? Perhaps you have a lovely environment back home you don't want to give up. And that's fine. But you should at least know what other opportunities are out there both for your information and potential change in the future. 
With that being said, here are the main Pros & Cons we see.
### Pros 
  - **High salaries**: In general, salaries at FAANG companies are bigger than at any local companies, no matter the location.   Salaries before taxes can be [on this website](https://www.levels.fyi/leaderboard/Software-Engineer/Entry-Level-Engineer/country/Romania/), which are accurate in our experience. At FAANG you will also receive a part of your TC (total compensation) in stocks, which are taxed lower than normal salary. We will split the discussion into western and eastern salaries for internships, software engineers and managerial positions. Our examples are from Microsoft and Google, but this holds for many big companies. Some, like hedge funds, go much higher than this.
    - *Internships*: In Romania, Poland, etc, you will get about 2000 euro / month **after taxes** + relocation bonus which amounts to about 3000-4000 euro. If you find cheap or free rent, you can keep all of it no questions asked. For western high-paying cities such as London and Zurich, you may reach up to 8000 euro / month **before** taxes, which translates, depending on the country, to about 5000-6000 euro / month after taxes. Relocation bonus is also higher, reaching 5000-8000 euro for the duration of the internship. 
    - *Software engineers*: In the east, you start with about 5000-6000 euro / month **before taxes**, meaning about 3500 euro / month after taxes at **entry level**. At senior, level you get about twice as much. In the west, you can expect around 10k-15k euro / month before taxes at entry level, reaching up to 30k euro / month at senior level. 
    - *Managerial positions*: To get here you will have to put in the effort and surpass senior level. These guys coordinate small or large teams and reach up to 100k euro / month before taxes, which amounts to about 1.2M / year. Not everyone will get here, but if you are looking for the *safe* route to millions, this is probably it. 
  - **No bullshit culture**: You are much less likely to find the "year of experience" criteria and can become a senior or even a manager in 2-3 years, perhaps even faster, if you are good enough. Most people are able to become seniors in about 4 years, without having extreme technical feats of destroying their lives in the process.
  - **Potential for Startups / Opportunities / Exits**: There is an infamous metric called tenure (how much an engineer stays employed on average), [which for FAANG is about 2-3 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/average-employee-tenure-retention-at-top-tech-companies-2018-4 ). Most people who work at FAANG benefit from several opportunities attached to the prestige. For the most part, being considered the top 1% (even if you aren't) will allow you to get interviews easily almost everywhere and obtain higher salary, as well as easier access to VC funding if you want to make a startup. Considering the fact that after 3 years you will have between 100k-500k euro saved up (unless you are a really big spender), puts you in a good position in terms of money, knowledge, people and expectations. Or perhaps, [you are into goose farming](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dryuan/?trk=public_post_embed_feed-actor-name), whatever makes you fulfilled.
  - **Unique knowledge and high quality network** :There are certain phenomenas both in [nature and software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) which appear only at large scales. The knowledge required to handle such systems is very rare, given that there are not so many BIG softwares in the world and most of them are owned by FAANG companies. The infrastructure you will see there is unique and will give you a much broader perspective into building projects as a whole. Additionally, the people there will have the same know-how as you do now and the same advantages as you. This tends to make employees of FAANG companies to band together for future projects and helping each other out in the industry. Furthermore, FAANG is where the money is, so having a successful startup exit, creating a consulting company or whatever high money activity you want to run (legally) will be much easier given the connections and high expectations.
  - **Possibility to move abroad**: Being international companies, you can request team changes and moving abroad, which can be quite useful in the case of both internal and external threats for your country.

Of course, life is not perfect and neither is FAANG, so below are the main cons of working at a FAANG company.
### Cons
  - **Stupid hiring criteria / High initial investment**: A college student from the US has recently made 22 million dollars in about 40 days by selling a tool called [Interview coder](https://www.interviewcoder.co), with a slogan we are not going to name. It is an overlay over your browser which used during interviews which sends questions to chatgpt and displays responses. The student made a demo by getting internships at Amazon and Citadel and then got kicked out of school. Most big tech companies are currently employing leetcode style of interviews, which in a sense is an advantage, allowing you to have some predictability. But in most other ways, it's a really bad way of evaluating a candidate and will miss many of their actual skills (or lack thereof). Until this trend changes, you will have to know you algorithms and data structures right and do lots of leetcode problems, which can be a really wasteful use of your time and tends to turn into a large memorization + interpolation of algorithms, without testing any adaptability, capacity of understanding or passion. For example, the creator of homebrew, a software which most of Google employees use, [was rejected by Google for not being able to invert a binary tree](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34288766).
  - **Work-life balance**: This one depends both on you and the company but **With lots of power, comes lots of responsability**. Being in one of the big tech companies will require you to be a high performer and do your job WELL. Despite this, some companies such as Microsoft and Netflix allow full remote work, with Netflix not even mandating any work our, just a "do your job" policy. On the other hand Amazon is known for grinding their employees down and mandating them to go to the office 5 days a week. Another example if Nvidia, which would rather [torture you to greatness](https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-torture-employees-to-greatness-culture/) than fire you. However, if you are the kind to want more from your life and want to put the work in it, these kinds of environments might be beneficial if they reward you properly, which some do and some don't. 
  - **Layoffs**: Tied to work-life balance section, there have been lots of layoffs after Covid, and it seems that even if this trend has faded, it is still always lurking in the shadows. Just recently, Meta started putting "firing targets", aiming to layoff ["low performing employees"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/15/meta-to-fire-thousands-of-staff-mark-zuckerberg-warns-of-intense-year), which is a trend that might accelerate with the whole AI wave, justified or not.
  - **Limited scope**: Again, this one depends on your purpose, but working on large systems will have you occupy an extremely tiny space and not seeing the overview and understanding why things are as they are. This contradicts with the Unique knowledge section, and there is some duality to it. In small companies / startups you can expect to be involved in many operations and develop your skills quite aggresively while in big companies, you are expected to work on really narrow parts of an already existing project. This is not specific to FAANG, more like tha natural lifecycle of any company which needs to maintain some product, but you should be aware of it nonetheless. However, most big tech companies allow their employees to move between projects or even do internal career changes, so this con can be avoided or diminished.
  - **No ownership**: Not really specific to big tech but the industry as a whole. If you do outstanding work, there is a good chance you will get nothing other than a bonus out of it. However, this can be mitigated by paving the way to a startup by working at a FAANG company as mentioned above.
### Mixed
  - Relocations, can be both a disadvantage or an advantage, depending on what you want from life. If you want to be near your family and friends, being forced to move into another city might be quite a big issue. At the same time if you want to stay far away from your "family and friends", moving to another city might be quite a big bonus. Despite this, there are companies which [allow 100% remote work](https://www.levels.fyi/remote/), so there are virtually no drawbacks no matter your circumstances.

### FAANG interns getting rejected at local companies
One interesting phenomena is that many of the FAANG interns who contributed to this guide or we spoke to have been rejected, both for internships and jobs by local companies, with the same CV that got them into FAANG. We are not going to name the companies, but their salary range for interns ranged between 150-500 euro / month, the seniors were expected to have 10 years of experience to get 4000 euro / month before taxes, which means somewhere about 2500 euro / month. This rejection also happened to individuals who were previously and tried to apply to local companies after their internship has ended. 

In one particular instance, a student at the beginning of the third year to applied to about 50 jobs/internships in Romania, 6 other in Europe, 3 of which were FAANG companies. All the 50 companies rejected him at screening phase, while 2 FAANG companies as well as a German company sent him online assesments. He now has an internship Google, despite being rejected by every single one of the Romanian companies. 

In another case, the companies who were supposed to hire students at a local job shop, seemed to take pride in bragging how many applicants they have each time they open a job and how none of them has any chance basically. Showing them your CV leads to a complete dismissal of you as a person and any kind of value you could have because they have "THOUSANDS OF APPLICANTS". This, again, happened to an individual who now has an internship at Google.

The only logical moral of the story seems to be that you need at least 2 FAANG internships to even be considered by local companies and be paid 10 times less. So I guess that is a pro too ? 

### Mandatory motivational speech
Perhaps after skimming through this guide you still think that it is unthinkable to apply to FAANG and you stand no chance. But life isn't only made only of the current moment nor the current year. These companies have things they value and there is a way to achieve each one of those things and make them want you **with time** and **desire**. And we are here to help. The reason we made this guide is to maximize the number of people getting into prestigious positions and break this cycle of apathy, low expectations and lack of ambition who puts everyone down. People have potential, dreams, autonomy and can achieve great things with their lives and there is no reason to believe otherwise.

As the stories above suggest, one man's trash is another man's gold. Truth is many local companies are have a badly calibrated moral compass, which can be demoralizing and destroy confidence and hopes without any good reason. See through these things and understand truth for yourself. **The world will ask you who you are, and if you do not know, the world will tell you**.

If you truly want it, go for it and if you don't know, figure it out. But in the meantime we will be here to help with any decision you will take, whatever that may be.

## How to Faang from UTCN (or any Romanian university)

Hopefully, now you have a better idea of what FAANG is and why you might want to get in there. If you are 100% decided you want to get in, you can consider yourself halfway there, as becoming fully convinced of a purpose is the main bottleneck for most people. With that out of the way, lets get into the main stages you will go through.     

### Application screening

Application screening is meant to filter supposedly low-quality candidates, since companies can't afford to interview everyone for obvious reasons. Companies are very averse to false positives (people who are bad that were thought to be good) and would rather reject tons of good engineers along the bad ones on the ground that even one bad apple can ruin their team. You can be subject to screening rejections, we all are and its a part of the process that should not dissapoint you (unless everyone rejected you, then you might have an issue).

Not all companies use standardized reject/accept for candidates screening. Some like [Jetbrains allow you to do a small project](https://www.jetbrains.com/careers/internships/) instead. But most do a resume screening before the interviews, either by human reviewers or robot reviewers (we'll tackle both). So the question appears, how should you build a strong CV that passes screening for most companies ? We'll focus on two parts

1. **How to write your already existing achievements in your CV ?**
2. **How to have the achievements that are FAANG worthy in the first place ?**

#### How to write a strong CV ? 

You will find many opinions on this topic, many contradictory, but here what worked for every single one of us at this point. 

- **Looks:** There are [pleasent](https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/best-of-europe/most-beautiful-landscapes-in-europe-2/) and [unpleasent](https://websinu.utcluj.ro) things to look at. If a human is looking, a bad looking CV will take energy to decypher and look unprofessional, which decreases your chances, no matter what you got in there. There is a lot of [design theory](https://diegopiovesan.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/livro_-_the_non-designers_desi.pdf) on this, but in general, keep things simple, don't put multiple things which attract lots of attention, if there is a visual correlation between two things (size, font, allignment, boldness, position), then they should have something in common. We all use the [format in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCgn-7NBPSs), or something very similar. Notice how important stuff is **bold and big**, while details are smaller and written normally. Text with the same purpose, such as titles, are aligned with each other. Related informations about the same job are grouped near each other.
  - *Missconceptions:* Many people say your CV should *be personal*, *have a photo*, *have many colors*, etc. All these advices seems out of place. These additions do not confine any information about your employability or make your CV more appealing. In fact, they draw attention on the entire page all at once, becoming hard to follow and childish. People don't want to know you at this stage, so no personal statements, photos *(being hot does not help)* or human stuff. Just raw info that is as convincing and digestible as possible.  
- **Content:** Your main sections should be Education, Work / Startup experience, Projects. Depending on your personal achievements, also consider adding an Achievements, Research experience, Open source or whatever else makes up a good chunk of your value. For the content writing, we recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCgn-7NBPSs) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUy1yvjHxE) videos, they cover most of the info you need. Below are some important notes both found through the videos or our personal experience: 
  - **If you worked for a project full-time**, especially if managed to attract any customers/investments, just put it under work experience, even if it wasn't an official business. You put your heart into it and it shouldn't be labelled as just a project if it was more than that, but make sure that people understand it was a personal thing and not a shadow company. Some of us did this, it was never an issue and interviewers were generally very happy about big projects which had results.
  - **Have concrete indicators of success** attached to anything. Won a hackathon should be scored first out of 45 international teams (or top % if you didn't win first). Attracted users should be gained trafic of 2000 visitors per month and 50 sign-ups. Reduced downtime by 80%. Scored GPA top 5% of my class. Led 21 people. Try to think of any possible quantifiable metric of your success and put it there. It doesn't have to be exact, but roughly true (if you had 72.2425% speedup just say 75%). Not every sentence is mandatory to have an indicator, but try to use as many as possible. 
  - **No useless talk**. People yap way too much and do way too little. Just say whatever you did, make it concrete and understandable, don't overinflate your achievements too much (a bit is recommended though) and don't start writing degenerate linkdin posts generated by LLM's in your CV such as "I had the delightful experience of honing my skills and meeting ...". This kind of approach doesn't tell anything about depth of the skills or their implications in the future. **You have to ground your achievements in something tied to reality**, one way or another, because grounding means credibility. Rotting for 2 days at a hackathon without any long-term progress or effort should not be classified as "honing your skills". 

For editing, word is good, latex is better. You can take the template in the video and put in your own data, it works well for any information really. 

#### How to have great achievements ( By Alexander the great and turkeys ) ? 

<!--
Here speak about following premade, known paths associated with success and value
-->

You can take roughly two approaches here and we will start each with its own little story.

Research in the 1950s showed that when turkeys were exposed to a specific acoustic stimulus (such as “chip chirip”), nearly 95% of them automatically performed a fixed sequence of behaviors of protecting whatever object made the sound, no matter if the "chip chirip" came from an actual chick or a rock. This phenomena is called [fixed action pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_action_pattern) and is relevant in most living animals **including humans**. This means, in other words, that certain stimulus or inputs produce automatic responses in the brain, associated with concepts, such as maternity for tukeys, or, perhaps, **how successful you evaluate someone to be** for humans.

I think everyone at some point of their lived hear about someone they didn't meet personally doing something like building a business, going to olympiads, doing research or whatever and had an instant impression about them: "they are successful", "they are smart", "they will have lots of money" and the list goes on. These associations are part of how we understand the world and are necesarry, but also exploitable. This will be our first approach in building a strong CV: **Associating ourselves with indicators of success**. These can manifest in several ways:

- Previous work experience / internships
- Olympiads
- Research 
- Open source contributions 

For us, our most tested ones are previous work experience and olympiads. People who had either of these in their CV generally passed the screening, especially if they had both. Obviously, not everyone will see value in the same things, and you are not guaranteed to pass, but if you pick achievements which are recognized broadly enough as success indicators, you are very likely to pass screening. These methods are not exhaustive and they can be combined with original, independent projects. For example, making a startup, which is an independent project, that leads to a large number of users, an indicator of success, would combine both the independence of startup and the validation of an indicator of success, the number of users. That being said, here goes our second story.   



Relating your achievements to existing proxies. 

Driving new proxies but grounding them into reality somehow. 


Somewhere around 335 BC. [Alexander the Great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlKJDwViNKs), one of the most successful conquerors of all time  encountered [Diogenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A3IlRATIsI), a homeless cycnic philosopher, who lived in a barrel, defecating, sunbathing and vibing all day long. Alexander deeply admired Diogenes for his uncompromising indepdendece of material wealth he rejected and courage to live by his own values. Alexander (the king) asked Diogenes (the homeless man) if he, could do anything for him. Diogenes replied "Get out of my sunlight".
