This is a full guide on how to get into a **prestigious, well-paid, international company** from UTCN (or any romanian college for that matter). The term FAANG originated from big tech giants (Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc), but is now more of an umbrella term for prestigious companies. 
This guide goes through the full proces of building and writing a strong CV that passes the screening, solving online assessments, nailing your interviews and finally getting an offer. 
We present both generic and company-specific info, as well as **recent real-life stories** with both successes and failures and how ridiculous the market can be sometimes. Enjoy.

## Why Faang?
Why should you choose an international FAANG company ? Perhaps you think local companies are good or you have a lovely environment back home you don't want to give up. And that's fine. But you should at least know what other opportunities are out there both for your information and potential change in the future. 
With that being said, here are the main Pros & Cons we see.
### Pros 
  - **High salaries**: In general, salaries at FAANG companies are bigger than at any local company, no matter the location. Salaries before taxes can be seen [on this website](https://www.levels.fyi/leaderboard/Software-Engineer/Entry-Level-Engineer/country/Romania/), which are accurate in our experience. We will split the discussion into western and eastern salaries for internships, software engineers and managerial positions. Our numbers are taken from Microsoft and Google, but they are similar for many big companies. Our eastern references are Warsaw and Bucharest, while the western ones are London and Zurich. Everything else falls somewhere in between.
    - *Internships*: In Romania, Poland, etc, you will get about **2000 euro / month after taxes** + a one-time relocation bonus of about **3000-4000 euro**. If you find cheap or free rent, you can keep all the money no questions asked. For western high-paying cities such as London and Zurich, you may reach up to 8000 euro / month before taxes, which translates, depending on the country, to about **5000-6000 euro / month after taxes**. Relocation bonus is also higher, being around **5000-8000 euro**. 
    - *Software engineers*: In the east, you start with about 5000-6000 euro / month before taxes, meaning about **3500 euro / month after taxes** at *entry level*. At senior level, your salary rougly doubles compared to entry level. In the west, you can expect around **10k-15k euro / month before taxes** at *entry level*, reaching up to 30k euro / month at senior level. 
    - *Managerial positions*: This position is for people who really want to progress and is not reached "naturally". They coordinate small and large teams reaching up to 100k euro / month before taxes, which amounts to about **1.2M / year before taxes** in the west. If you are looking for the *safe* route to millions, this is probably it. 
  - **No mediocrity culture**: You are much less likely to find the "years of experience" criteria, and much more likely to be evaluated based on capabilities. You can become a senior or even a manager in 2-3 years, perhaps even faster, if you are good enough. Most people are able to become seniors in about 4-5 years, without having extreme technical feats of destroying their lives in the process.
  - **Potential for Startups / Opportunities / Exits**: There is an infamous metric called tenure (how much an engineer stays employed on average), [which for FAANG is about 2-3 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/average-employee-tenure-retention-at-top-tech-companies-2018-4). Most people who work at FAANG benefit from several opportunities attached to the prestige. For the most part, being considered the top 1% (even if you aren't) will allow you to get interviews easily almost everywhere, switch jobs for a higher salary, as well as easier access to VC funding if you want to make a startup. Since after 3 years you will have between 100k-500k euro saved up (unless you are a really big spender), you will be in a good position in terms of money, knowledge, people and expectations, allowing you a lot of flexibility. For example, you might [consider goose farming](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dryuan/?trk=public_post_embed_feed-actor-name).
  - **Unique knowledge and high quality network**: There are certain phenomenas both in [nature and software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) which appear only in systems at large scales. The knowledge required to handle such systems is very rare, given that there are not so many huge softwares in the world and those that exist are owned by FAANG companies. The infrastructure you will see there is unique and will give you a much broader perspective into building projects as a whole. Moreover, the people there will have the same know-how as you do now and are useful to have around. For these reasons, employees of FAANG tend to stick together for future projects, startups or navigating jobs, creating somewhat of an elitist substrate. 
  - **Possibility to move abroad**: Since FAANGs are international companies, you can request to move to another country on a different team, a change which the company can facilitate. It will, of course, still depend on specific policies and your performance, but is generally an option. 

### Cons
  - **Stupid hiring criteria / High initial investment**: A college student from the US has recently made **22 million dollars in about 40 days** by selling a tool called [Interview coder](https://www.interviewcoder.co), with a slogan we are not going to name. It is an overlay over your browser which can be used during interviews to send your questions to chatgpt and display the responses. The student made a demo by getting internships at Amazon and Citadel, after which he got kicked out of school. Most big tech companies are currently employing leetcode based interviews, which in a sense is an advantage because it's predictable, but in most other ways, it's a really bad way of evaluating a candidate and will miss many of their actual skills (or lack thereof). Until this trend changes, you will have to know you algorithms and data structures well and do lots of [leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/), which can be a really wasteful use of your time and tends to turn into a large exercise of memorizing and combining algorithms. For example, the creator of homebrew, a software which most Google employees use, [was rejected by Google for not being able to invert a binary tree](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34288766).
  - **Work-life balance**: This one depends both on you and the company but **With lots of power, comes lots of responsability**. Being in one of the big tech companies will require you to be a high performer and do your job well. Some companies such as Microsoft and Netflix allow full remote work, with Netflix not even mandating any work hours, just a "do your job" policy. Others are not so merciful, with Amazon being known for grinding their employees down and mandating them to go to the office 5 days a week. Another example if Nvidia, which would rather [torture you to greatness](https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-torture-employees-to-greatness-culture/) than fire you. However, if you want to work a lot and get lots of money, some of these draconic environments might actually be a plus. 
  - **Layoffs**: There have been lots of layoffs after Covid, and even if this trend has faded, it's still lurking in the shadows. Just recently, Meta started putting "firing targets", aiming to layoff ["low performing employees"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/15/meta-to-fire-thousands-of-staff-mark-zuckerberg-warns-of-intense-year), which might accelerate with the whole AI hype wave, justified or not.
  - **Limited scope**: This one depends on your purpose, but working on large systems will have you occupy an extremely tiny space and not seeing the overview or understanding why things are as they are. This contradicts with the Unique knowledge section since there is some duality to it. In small companies / startups you can expect to be involved in many operations and develop your skills quite aggresively while in big companies, you are expected to work on really narrow parts of an already existing project. This is not specific to FAANG, more like the natural lifecycle of any company which needs to maintain some product, but you should be aware of it nonetheless. However, most big tech companies allow their employees to move between projects or even do internal career changes, so this Con can be avoided or diminished.
  - **No ownership**: Not really specific to big tech but the industry as a whole. If you do outstanding work, there is a good chance you will get nothing other than a bonus out of it. However, this can be mitigated by paving the way for a startup to appear by working at a FAANG company as mentioned above.

### Mixed
  - **Changing countries:** Relocations, can be both a disadvantage or an advantage, depending on what you want from life. If you want to be near your family and friends, being forced to move into another city might be quite a big issue. At the same time if you want to stay far away from your "family and friends", moving to another city might be quite a big bonus. Some companies [allow 100% remote work](https://www.levels.fyi/remote/) though, so there are virtually no drawbacks if you work for them.

### FAANG interns getting rejected at local companies
One interesting paradox is that many of the FAANG interns who contributed to this guide or we spoke to have been rejected, both for internships and jobs by local companies (with the same CV that got them into FAANG). This happened to several people, despite the popular belief that getting into FAANG is much harder or impossible, but right now it seems to be the easier than getting a normal internship. Not to mention the fact that, at least for internships, FAANG companies pay 2-4 times as much as local companies. 

More appalingly, you will still get you rejected many times, EVEN IF you have a FAANG internship on your CV. We believe this to be a widespread sympthom of [ghost jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_job), which are meant to collect data, not hire people. 

In one particular instance, a student has applied in the beginning of the third year to about 50 jobs/internships in Romania, 6  in Europe, 3 of which were FAANG companies. All the 50 Romanian companies rejected him at screening phase, while Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Blackrock, Goldman sachs as well as a random German company sent him online assesments. He now has an internship Google.

### Mandatory motivational speech
Perhaps the only logical moral of the story seems to be that you need at least 2 FAANG internships to even be considered by local companies So I guess that is a pro of FAANG too ? 

Jokes aside, it is clear the situation right now is not great, but there are ways to make it. FAANG is not as untouchable as people think and might actually be easier than believed. Even if you are completely unqualified now, life isn't only made only of the current moment nor the current year. FAANG companies have things they clearly value and there is a way to achieve each one of those things **with time** and **effort**. And we are here to help. The reason we made this guide is to maximize the number of people getting into prestigious positions and break the cycle of apathy, low expectations who puts everyone down. People have potential, dreams, autonomy and can achieve meaningful and fullfilling lives and there is no reason to believe otherwise.
