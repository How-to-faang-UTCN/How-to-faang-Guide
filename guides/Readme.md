This is a full guide on how to get into a **prestigious, well-paid, international company** from UTCN (or any romanian college for that matter). The term FAANG originated from big tech giants (Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc), but is now more of an umbrella term for prestigious companies. 
This guide goes through the full proces of building and writing a strong CV that passes the screening, solving online assessments, nailing your interviews and finally getting an offer. 
We present both generic and company-specific info, as well as **recent real-life stories** with both successes and failures and how ridiculous the market can be sometimes. Enjoy.

## Why Faang?
Why should you choose an international FAANG company ? Perhaps you think local companies are good or you have a lovely environment back home you don't want to give up. And that's fine. But you should at least know what other opportunities are out there both for your information and potential change in the future. 
With that being said, here are the main Pros & Cons we see.
### Pros 
  - **High salaries**: In general, salaries at FAANG companies are bigger than at any local company, no matter the location. Salaries before taxes can be seen [on this website](https://www.levels.fyi/leaderboard/Software-Engineer/Entry-Level-Engineer/country/Romania/), which are accurate in our experience. We will split the discussion into western and eastern salaries for internships, software engineers and managerial positions. Our numbers are taken from Microsoft and Google, but they are similar for many big companies. Our eastern references are Warsaw and Bucharest, while the western ones are London and Zurich. Everything else falls somewhere in between.
    - *Internships*: In Romania, Poland, etc, you will get about **2000 euro / month after taxes** + a one-time relocation bonus of about **3000-4000 euro**. If you find cheap or free rent, you can keep all the money no questions asked. For western high-paying cities such as London and Zurich, you may reach up to 8000 euro / month before taxes, which translates, depending on the country, to about **5000-6000 euro / month after taxes**. Relocation bonus is also higher, being around **5000-8000 euro**. 
    - *Software engineers*: In the east, you start with about 5000-6000 euro / month before taxes, meaning about **3500 euro / month after taxes** at *entry level*. At senior level, your salary rougly doubles compared to entry level. In the west, you can expect around **10k-15k euro / month before taxes** at *entry level*, reaching up to 30k euro / month at senior level. 
    - *Managerial positions*: This position is for people who really want to progress and is not reached "naturally". They coordinate small and large teams reaching up to 100k euro / month before taxes, which amounts to about **1.2M / year before taxes** in the west. If you are looking for the *safe* route to millions, this is probably it. 
  - **No mediocrity culture**: You are much less likely to find the "years of experience" criteria, and much more likely to be evaluated based on capabilities. You can become a senior or even a manager in 2-3 years, perhaps even faster, if you are good enough. Most people are able to become seniors in about 4-5 years, without having extreme technical feats of destroying their lives in the process.
  - **Potential for Startups / Opportunities / Exits**: There is an infamous metric called tenure (how much an engineer stays employed on average), [which for FAANG is about 2-3 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/average-employee-tenure-retention-at-top-tech-companies-2018-4). Most people who work at FAANG benefit from several opportunities attached to the prestige. For the most part, being considered the top 1% (even if you aren't) will allow you to get interviews easily almost everywhere, switch jobs for a higher salary, as well as easier access to VC funding if you want to make a startup. Since after 3 years you will have between 100k-500k euro saved up (unless you are a really big spender), you will be in a good position in terms of money, knowledge, people and expectations, allowing you a lot of flexibility. For example, you might [consider goose farming](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dryuan/?trk=public_post_embed_feed-actor-name).
  - **Unique knowledge and high quality network**: There are certain phenomenas both in [nature and software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) which appear only in systems at large scales. The knowledge required to handle such systems is very rare, given that there are not so many huge softwares in the world and those that exist are owned by FAANG companies. The infrastructure you will see there is unique and will give you a much broader perspective into building projects as a whole. Moreover, the people there will have the same know-how as you do now and are useful to have around. For these reasons, employees of FAANG tend to stick together for future projects, startups or navigating jobs, creating somewhat of an elitist substrate. 
  - **Possibility to move abroad**: Since FAANGs are international companies, you can request to move to another country on a different team, a change which the company can facilitate. It will, of course, still depend on specific policies and your performance, but is generally an option. 

### Cons
  - **Stupid hiring criteria / High initial investment**: A college student from the US has recently made **22 million dollars in about 40 days** by selling a tool called [Interview coder](https://www.interviewcoder.co), with a slogan we are not going to name. It is an overlay over your browser which can be used during interviews to send your questions to chatgpt and display the responses. The student made a demo by getting internships at Amazon and Citadel, after which he got kicked out of school. Most big tech companies are currently employing leetcode based interviews, which in a sense is an advantage because it's predictable, but in most other ways, it's a really bad way of evaluating a candidate and will miss many of their actual skills (or lack thereof). Until this trend changes, you will have to know you algorithms and data structures well and do lots of [leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/), which can be a really wasteful use of your time and tends to turn into a large exercise of memorizing and combining algorithms. For example, the creator of homebrew, a software which most Google employees use, [was rejected by Google for not being able to invert a binary tree](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34288766).
  - **Work-life balance**: This one depends both on you and the company but **With lots of power, comes lots of responsability**. Being in one of the big tech companies will require you to be a high performer and do your job well. Some companies such as Microsoft and Netflix allow full remote work, with Netflix not even mandating any work hours, just a "do your job" policy. Others are not so merciful, with Amazon being known for grinding their employees down and mandating them to go to the office 5 days a week. Another example if Nvidia, which would rather [torture you to greatness](https://fortune.com/2024/09/05/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-torture-employees-to-greatness-culture/) than fire you. However, if you want to work a lot and get lots of money, some of these draconic environments might actually be a plus. 
  - **Layoffs**: There have been lots of layoffs after Covid, and even if this trend has faded, it's still lurking in the shadows. Just recently, Meta started putting "firing targets", aiming to layoff ["low performing employees"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/15/meta-to-fire-thousands-of-staff-mark-zuckerberg-warns-of-intense-year), which might accelerate with the whole AI hype wave, justified or not.
  - **Limited scope**: This one depends on your purpose, but working on large systems will have you occupy an extremely tiny space and not seeing the overview or understanding why things are as they are. This contradicts with the Unique knowledge section since there is some duality to it. In small companies / startups you can expect to be involved in many operations and develop your skills quite aggresively while in big companies, you are expected to work on really narrow parts of an already existing project. This is not specific to FAANG, more like the natural lifecycle of any company which needs to maintain some product, but you should be aware of it nonetheless. However, most big tech companies allow their employees to move between projects or even do internal career changes, so this Con can be avoided or diminished.
  - **No ownership**: Not really specific to big tech but the industry as a whole. If you do outstanding work, there is a good chance you will get nothing other than a bonus out of it. However, this can be mitigated by paving the way for a startup to appear by working at a FAANG company as mentioned above.

### Mixed
  - **Changing countries:** Relocations, can be both a disadvantage or an advantage, depending on what you want from life. If you want to be near your family and friends, being forced to move into another city might be quite a big issue. At the same time if you want to stay far away from your "family and friends", moving to another city might be quite a big bonus. Some companies [allow 100% remote work](https://www.levels.fyi/remote/) though, so there are virtually no drawbacks if you work for them.

### FAANG interns getting rejected at local companies
One interesting paradox is that many of the FAANG interns who contributed to this guide or we spoke to have been rejected, both for internships and jobs by local companies (with the same CV that got them into FAANG). This happened to several people, despite the popular belief that getting into FAANG is much harder or impossible, but right now it seems to be the easier than getting a normal internship. Not to mention the fact that, at least for internships, FAANG companies pay 2-4 times as much as local companies. 

More appalingly, you will still get you rejected many times, EVEN IF you have a FAANG internship on your CV. We believe this to be a widespread sympthom of [ghost jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_job), which are meant to collect data, not hire people. 

In one particular instance, a student has applied in the beginning of the third year to about 50 jobs/internships in Romania, 6  in Europe, 3 of which were FAANG companies. All the 50 Romanian companies rejected him at screening phase, while Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Blackrock, Goldman sachs as well as a random German company sent him online assesments. He now has an internship Google.

### Mandatory motivational speech
Perhaps the only logical moral of the story seems to be that you need at least 2 FAANG internships to even be considered by local companies So I guess that is a pro of FAANG too ? 

Jokes aside, it is clear the situation right now is not great, but there are ways to make it. FAANG is not as untouchable as people think and might actually be easier than believed. Even if you are completely unqualified now, life isn't only made only of the current moment nor the current year. FAANG companies have things they clearly value and there is a way to achieve each one of those things **with time** and **effort**. And we are here to help. The reason we made this guide is to maximize the number of people getting into prestigious positions and break the cycle of apathy, low expectations who puts everyone down. People have potential, dreams, autonomy and can achieve meaningful and fullfilling lives and there is no reason to believe otherwise.

## How to Faang from UTCN (or any Romanian university)

Hopefully, now you have a better idea of what FAANG is and why you might want to get in there. If you are 100% decided you want to get in, you can consider yourself halfway there, as becoming fully convinced of a purpose is the main bottleneck for most people. With that out of the way, lets get into the main stages you will go through.     

### Application Screening

Application screening is meant to filter supposedly low-quality candidates, since companies can't afford to interview everyone for obvious reasons. Companies are very averse to false positives (people who are bad that were thought to be good) and would rather reject tons of good engineers along the bad ones on the ground that even one bad apple can ruin their team. You can be subject to screening rejections, we all are and its a part of the process that should not dissapoint you (unless everyone rejected you, then you might have an issue).

Not all companies use standardized reject/accept for candidates screening. Some like [Jetbrains allow you to do a small project](https://www.jetbrains.com/careers/internships/) instead. But most do a resume screening before the interviews, either by human reviewers or robot reviewers (we'll tackle both). So the question appears, how should you build a strong CV that passes screening for most companies ? We'll focus on two parts

1. **How to write your already existing achievements in your CV ?**
2. **How to have the achievements that are FAANG worthy in the first place ?**

#### How To Write A Strong CV ? 

You will find many opinions on this topic, many contradictory, but here what worked for every single one of us at this point. 

- **Looks:** There are [pleasent](https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/best-of-europe/most-beautiful-landscapes-in-europe-2/) and [unpleasent](https://websinu.utcluj.ro) things to look at. If a human is looking, a bad looking CV will take energy to decypher and look unprofessional, which decreases your chances, no matter what you got in there. There is a lot of [design theory](https://diegopiovesan.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/livro_-_the_non-designers_desi.pdf) on this, but in general, keep things simple, don't put multiple things which attract lots of attention, if there is a visual correlation between two things (size, font, allignment, boldness, position), then they should have something in common. We all use the [format in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCgn-7NBPSs), or something very similar. Notice how important stuff is **bold and big**, while details are smaller and written normally. Text with the same purpose, such as titles, are aligned with each other. Related informations about the same job are grouped near each other.
  - *Missconceptions:* Many people say your CV should *be personal*, *have a photo*, *have many colors*, etc. All these advices seems out of place. These additions do not confine any information about your employability or make your CV more appealing. In fact, they draw attention on the entire page all at once, becoming hard to follow and childish. People don't want to know you at this stage, so no personal statements, photos *(being hot does not help)* or human stuff. Just raw info that is as convincing and digestible as possible.  
- **Content:** Your main sections should be Education, Work / Startup experience, Projects. Depending on your personal achievements, also consider adding an Achievements, Research experience, Open source or whatever else makes up a good chunk of your value. For the content writing, we recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCgn-7NBPSs) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUy1yvjHxE) videos, they cover most of the info you need. Below are some important notes both found through the videos or our personal experience: 
  - **If you worked for a project full-time**, especially if managed to attract any customers/investments, just put it under work experience, even if it wasn't an official business. You put your heart into it and it shouldn't be labelled as just a project if it was more than that, but make sure that people understand it was a personal thing and not a shadow company. Some of us did this, it was never an issue and interviewers were generally very happy about big projects which had results.
  - **Have concrete indicators of success** attached to anything. "Won a hackathon" should be "scored first out of 45 international teams" (or top % if you didn't win first). "Attracted users" should be "gained trafic of 2000 visitors per month and 50 sign-ups". Others include "Reduced downtime by 80%". "Scored GPA top 5% of my class". "Led 21 people". Try to think of any possible quantifiable metric of your success and put it there. It doesn't have to be exact, but roughly true (if you had 72.2425% speedup just say 75%). Not every sentence is mandatory to have an indicator, but try to use as many as possible. 
  - **Be real about yourself**. It is good to inflate your achievements a bit, but not too much. Many people try to create sci-fi stories about how they went to x place, and became a new 100x smarter individual, which apart from a few exceptions, are not real. Instead of using something like "I had the delightful experience of honing my skills and meeting ...", try to invest your time into some long term purpose which shows desire, resolve, effort, adaptability, intelligence and so on which produces **achievements tied to reality**, like the metrics discussed above. People will see through attempts at distorting / inflating, either sooner or later. 
  
For editing, word is good, latex is better. You can take the template in the video and put in your own data, it works well for any information really. 

#### How To Have Great Achievements ( By Alexander the great and dogs ) ? 

You can take roughly two approaches here and we will start each with its own little story.

**First story:** 

In the early 1900s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov conducted a series of famous experiments that laid the foundation for our understanding of [conditioned reflexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning). Pavlov's research showed that dogs would start to salivate when they heard a bell if the bell was repeatedly paired with food. The dogs learned to connect the bell with food, causing them to salivate even when no food was present. 

Similarly, humans can connect certain ideas with certain outcomes, if they see / hear them in pairs repeatedly, either by personal experience or by cultural assimilation. I think everyone at some point of their lived hear about someone they didn't meet personally doing something like building a business, going to olympiads, doing research or whatever and had an instant impression about them: "they are successful", "they are smart", "they will have lots of money" and the list goes on. These associations are part of how we understand the world and are necesarry, but also exploitable. They can be used to make the recruiter salivate to your potential success when they read your CV exactly as Pavolv dogs were salivating to the sound of the bell. This will be our first approach in building a strong CV: **Associating ourselves with indicators of success**. These can manifest in several ways:

- Previous work experience / internships
- Olympiads
- Research 
- Open source contributions 

For us, our most tested ones are previous work experience and olympiads. People who had either of these in their CV generally passed the screening, especially if they had both. Obviously, not everyone will see value in the same things, and you are not guaranteed to pass, but if you pick achievements which are recognized broadly enough as success indicators, you are very likely to pass screening. **However there is a very important tradeoff you should be aware of**

**Working on many of these indicators are useless and will hinder your true growth**.

School grades are the closest example, which despite bringing tons of frustration, are still a formal indicator of success, at least in academia. Another example is work experience. Some people truly grow during their work in the company and become better, while others experience bad management and tight deadlines which hinder any attempt at investing in long term knowledge. This doesn't make work experience and grades inherintly bad or useless, but it does make them unproductive at least in some contexts, despite them briging validation.

These methods are not exhaustive and some, such as research, allow you enough flexbility to do what you want but in a more validation effective context (publishing). That being said, there is also an alternative route, where you can take full initiative and rip off all the validation from the "stadard" paths. That being said, here goes our second story.   

**Second story:**

Somewhere around 335 BC. [Alexander the Great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlKJDwViNKs), one of the most successful conquerors of all time  encountered [Diogenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A3IlRATIsI), a homeless cycnic philosopher, who lived in a barrel, defecating, sunbathing and vibing all day long. Alexander deeply admired Diogenes for his uncompromising indepdendece of material wealth he rejected and courage to live by his own values. Alexander (the king) asked Diogenes (the homeless man) if he, could do anything for him. Diogenes replied "Get out of my sunlight".  

Despite being a king and a conqueror, Diogenes did something that Alexander deeply respected him for, no matter their circumstances. **He had the courage to take a different path**. Even if it lead him into a barrel. Probably when you read the stories in this guide, you were a bit shocked at their presence in a tech tutorial. And that is because unexpectedness, change and the courage to do something different can leave strong impressions, which we aim to exploit.

But at this point, you might argue "Yes, but my interviewer won't be Alexander the Great, king of all of Macedonia, how is that relevant?" and you are partly right. If Alexander were to conduct all the tech interviews, we would have taken over the galaxy a long  time ago. But he is not, so here we are still doing leetcode problems. Your interviewer is not Alexander, but **he is human** and he is susceptible to **attention grabbing and being impressed by new things**.  This is our main weapon if we choose not to do go with standard indicator of success, but our own thing: 

**Doing something new and courageous leaves strong impressions, if understood**

That "if understood" at the end is pesky. You have significant chances to meet someone who simply never exited their comfort zone and doesn't appreciate anything else other than standardized metrics. Is there way to convince these people too ? Yes it is, and if it wasn't we would find one. What if, lets say, you were to do something new, but **with a context attached to it** ? For example, doing a startup can mean a million things. But doing a startup which attracted lets say 10000 users and 5000$ in VC funds allows both for the original, courageous part "doing a startup" as well as the benefits of having a success indicator "5000$ in VC and 10000 users". You are essentially combining the best of both worlds. So whatever you are doing, no matter if it is original or standardized, try to think to yourself "How can I ground this thing in understandable indicators ?", no matter if they are emotions, of VC funds, users, published research, open source stars and the list goes on. Always keep the connection to reality and have something to ground your success in. Here the methods that worked for us are doing **startups** which gained about 100-200 sign-ups and between 2000-3000 thousands visits each month (albeit with some active marketing on reddit).
