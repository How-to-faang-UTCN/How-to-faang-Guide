This is a full guide on how to get into a FAANG company ( or generally well paid, international companies or startups ). It goes through the full process of planning, how to have a strong CV, how to write the CV, applying, interviews and finally getting an offer. We also have real life stories that might show the other non idealized side of the story as well as specific info on each company. This guide is done specifically for UTCN or any other romanian university and what has worked for us up to this point.

## Why Faang?
Why should you choose a FAANG company ? Perhaps you have a lovely environment back home you don't want to give up. And that's fine. But you should know what other opportunities are out there both for your information and potential decision changes in the future.

### Pros & Cons
- **Advantages:**
    - Salaries are much higher than in normal companies. For software engineers, they reach up to 30k euro / month and for managerial positions ( staff engineer and higher ) they reach up to 100k euro / month ( 1.2M per year ), in high paying cities such as London and Zurich. Even in Romania, the internships salaries are are about 2000 euro / M and salaries for senior engineers reach about 10k/M, which compared to other local business is almost twice as high. More info can be found on [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi). We can confirm many of these numbers. In zurich, the average software engineer intern makes 8000 euro / M.
    - Potential for startups / high expectations. Most Faang engineers quit in just a few years and either live with their millions of dollars or start making startups. At that point you really have all the flexibility in the world..
    - No bullshit culture. You wont find that many year of experience bullshit and can become a senior or even a manager in 2-3 years, perhaps even faster, if you are good enough.
    - Unique knowledge and networking. THe only place where infrastructure at that scale and actually impactful projects are don
    - Very good exit. If you grind you ass off 10 years you will have more money then you can spend for the rest of your life and can easily go part-time or just plain quit. Many good engineers decide to stay since at that point they dont really do that much anymore
- **Disadvantages:**
    - High initial investment: Leetcodoe and potentially working a lot in the next 5 years after college
    - Work life balance, might be pretty bad in the first few years, but if you are the ambitions kind, it will pay off.
- **Others**
    - Relocations, can be both a disadvantage or an advantage, depends on what you want from life

Faang is an umbrella, but can mean anything from classical big tech, to hedge funds like Jane street and citadel

### Faang interns getting rejected at local companies (stories)
One interesting thing is that most FAANG interns we spoke to have been rejected at local companies, such as Bosch, Continental and so on, on the ground of not being good enough. So at this point, it is very likely that if you were rejected by a lot of companies, you might as well apply to FAANG since it is easier in many ways to get in. Ironically, in one case, an individual who has applied to 5 Faangs, 50 local companeis and 3 foreign companies, has passed screening only at Google, Microsoft and a company from Germany.

Bullet points to follow
- **Definition and scope:** What is Faang, why it matters
- **Why choose Faang:** Benefits, opportunities, and challenges
- **Overview:** Pathways into Faang (including Faang classic, hedge funds, and other large tech firms)
- **Stories:** People need to know how messed up the other companies are
